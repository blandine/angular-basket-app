# A basket app with Angular

This is my first app with Angular.

To run it :
<code>
 // in the project directory <br/>
 npm install<br/>
 grunt
 </code>

 Go to http://localhost:9001

 TODO :

 * Add unit tests for services
 * Add UI tests
 * Build js (browserify)
 * Extract the breadcrumb view and manage it in a global scope
 * Extract style (and maybe add styles using sass)
 * Add localStorage
